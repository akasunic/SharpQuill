# Mini projects built on SharpQuill

Please see Joan Charmant's SharpQuill for the original code and documentation. [SharpQuill by Joan Charmant](https://github.com/JoanCharmant/SharpQuill)
These are just mini projects built using SharpQuill. Most are broken or experimental/partially finised. A few (below) are somewhat usable as is.
Please reach out if you'd like access to standalone versions of any of the mini apps. Please also feel free to fork any code for your own projects.

## Use cases
- Duplicating and renaming layers automatically to get setup for blendshape creation (see Create Blendshapes Starter)
= Automation of creating a steady particles effect in Quill (see Particle Generator)
- Automation of visemes for characters in Quill, integrating [Rhubarb Lip Sync](https://github.com/DanielSWolf/rhubarb-lip-sync). (see VisemesWinFormsApp)

## Limitations
-There are a lot. In the standalone versions, I typically link to a Google doc. Maybe I will link these docs here later...
