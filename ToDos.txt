UNRESOLVED/To Do
code clean up!! overall
Have instractions for original one layer/one folder file: Need to make sure the paint layers are transformation free, this will make things easiest!!! just don't use the whole layer transform option and you'll be good. If you've already done so, just combine, reset transform, and separate again.
SO: have an interface of some kind (can even just be a message/warning) when you run createBlendshapesstarter
Have a warning again when you run PostLayerCleanup, because you may want to just do it manually if you forgot or whatever

Then comment through everything to improve readability and replicability 
Eg make sure you know why you made certain code choices in case you come back here later even though I know you probably forgot a bunch..
And then test everything out again
Oh and make sure at the top of the files you explain like the overall goal. Like for blendshapes. And how you expect the file to look, like one head layer or group layer, and then individual paint layers for reye, leye


Some things to remember for code comments (off the top of my head): so when you make a new drawing, you need to create the bounding box separately and expand it with any newly incorporated ones, and then when it's ready, you can add that to the drawing. It wasn't setting when I tried to do it straight from drawing for some reason
Also be wary of references to objects vs deep(ish) copies of an object, when that's relevant (though I mgiht have been wrong sometimes but whatever)

A reminder for process for blendshapes (maybe put this somewhere in the comments): optimize first before running the program to copy all the layers!!
also provide relevant links 

RESOLVED/Done
